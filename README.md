#### I was not sure whether to write a spring boot application and tests Or to create a Java project that implements the Pet API, so I did both.

I have implemented using Java.

* Folder JavaProject - Implemented using Java Class
* Folder SpringBootApplication - Implemented using Spring Boot Application

Both folder contain their individual ReadMe.md files explaining how to run the project.

`Pre-requisites-`
######JDK 1.8
######Maven
